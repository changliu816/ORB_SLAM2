#1 Enter into the ORB_SLAM2 folder. In my case: 
cd /home/chang/slam_build/ORB_SLAM2

#2 Execute the following command
./Examples/Monocular/mono_euroc Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Monocular/test2.yaml /home/chang/slam_build/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/images /home/chang/slam_build/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/e3.txt

where 
/test2.yaml  : calibration file
/images:       folder that contains images
/e3.txt:       the name of each files or images in /images folder. Typically it means the timestamps of each frame, but in our case, just name of files.
