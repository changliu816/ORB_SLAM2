#1 Extract the frame from video taken by smartphone
Use extract_frame.m to extract the frame from video

#2 Extract the filename of files in a folder 
Use extract_filename.m to generate e3.txt(whichever name)

#3 Enter into the ORB_SLAM2 folder. In my case: 
cd /home/chang/slam_build/ORB_SLAM2

#4 Execute the following command
./Examples/Monocular/mono_euroc Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Monocular/test2.yaml /home/chang/slam_build/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/images /home/chang/slam_build/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/e3.txt

where 
/test2.yaml  : calibration file
/images:       folder that contains images
/e3.txt:       the name of each files or images in /images folder. Typically it means the timestamps of each frame, but in our case, just name of files.

#5 After program is compleled
Use trajectory.m to generate the GPS of trajectory.
1)The scale factor 's' is caculated only based on 1 trial. It's recommended to do scaling again to make sure the accuracy.
 - Procedues are also shown in green area
2) Input the GPS of start point at line 41
3) Input the third options of function flat2lla at line 47 according to real situation.
3rd option: Angular direction of flat Earth x-axis (degrees clockwise from north), which is the angle in degrees used for converting flat Earth x and y coordinates to North and East coordinates.
